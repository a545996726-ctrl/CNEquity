"""Carry the no-network guard into subprocesses.

`tests/conftest.py` patches `socket.socket.connect` in the *pytest* process.
`worker_pool` uses `ProcessPoolExecutor`, and on every platform this project
supports the child is a fresh interpreter (`spawn` on Windows/macOS,
`forkserver` on Linux 3.14+) that re-imports everything and inherits none of
that patching. A child was free to reach the network, which is the half of the
guard nobody would notice was missing: the parent's tests look fast and clean
while the work actually happens elsewhere.

Python runs `sitecustomize` at interpreter start, before any user code, so
putting the directory that holds this file on `PYTHONPATH` extends the guard to
every descendant — pool workers and `subprocess.run([sys.executable, ...])`
alike. It is inert unless `CNE_TEST_NO_NETWORK` is set, so it does nothing to a
normal `cne` run that happens to share the environment.
