"""How often each daily schedule group fetches: every session, or once a week.

``[job.daily.groups.<name>] cadence = "weekly"`` makes a group fetch its
history datasets once a week instead of every session. A history dataset
(``fetch_semantics != "snapshot"``) catches the missed sessions up by date on
the next due run, so fetching it weekly loses nothing and a scheduler that
wakes daily simply skips it in between.

Snapshot datasets keep fetching every session even inside a weekly group: they
only ever describe *today* (fund flow, hot rank, trading status, …), so a day
not fetched is a day lost for good. Their in-group dependencies run with them.

A weekly group is due on the last exchange session of each ISO week, up to
``weekday`` (ISO, 1=Mon…5=Fri, default 5). A Friday holiday therefore moves the
run to Thursday rather than skipping the week.

Freshness follows the cadence: a history dataset owned only by weekly groups is
judged against the group's last due session, not today, so ``cne status``, the
late stale pass and the health gate do not call it stale — and re-fetch it —
on the days it is meant to rest.
