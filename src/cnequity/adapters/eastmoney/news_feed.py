"""EastMoney 7×24 fast news, fetched since the newest item the lake holds.

The old fetch asked for "today" (Beijing) from the newest item backwards and
dropped everything dated otherwise. Run every 15 minutes, that re-paged the
whole day each time, and — because a run just after midnight asks for the new
day — dropped whatever was published between the day's last run and midnight;
a day the job did not run was lost although the API still pages back to it.
``news_headlines`` and ``flash_news_wire`` also each paged the same list.

This fetch walks newest-first until it passes *since* and keeps every item at
or after it, whatever its date; each row carries its own publish date. The
caller shares one fetch between both datasets (``steps/news_feed.py``), and
the exact page bytes are recorded so each dataset archives its own copy.
