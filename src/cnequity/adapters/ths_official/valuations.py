"""Valuation snapshots from the 同花顺 official API.

The endpoint has no history at all — it answers for today and nothing else, and
the contract says so plainly. That reads like a weakness and mostly is, but it
is also the one thing the lake's own valuation history cannot offer.

``valuation_metrics`` holds 16,457,034 rows from baostock covering 2001 onward.
Those are **restated**: a ratio computed now, from the share count and earnings
as they are understood now, and stamped with an old date. That is the right
series for a like-for-like comparison across time and the wrong one for asking
what a screen would have seen on the day. The dataset says as much —
``pit=none``.

A snapshot taken today and kept is the other thing. Nothing reconstructs it
later, which is exactly why it is worth accumulating: run this daily and the
store grows a licensed record of what the market actually showed, one session at
a time. It cannot backfill a single day before the first run.

Cheap enough to make that routine: the endpoint takes 100 securities per
request, so the whole market costs about 55 of them.

Three of the lake's five columns map. ``total_mv`` and ``float_mv`` have no
counterpart here, and the upstream's ``pe_mrq`` and ``pcf_ttm`` have none in the
lake — neither is invented in either direction.
