"""What each exchange is, and which sources can speak for it.

Beijing needed the same facts in forty places: when the exchange started,
which sources carry it, which fields a source leaves out. Each place kept
its own copy, so a new source or a corrected date had to be found in every
one of them. They live here now; ingestion, derivation and the audit read
them from this module.

Coverage is named by *capability*, not by adapter: Baostock's k-data and its
ST history are one capability, TDX's daily bars and its intraday records are
two, because they cover different exchanges.
