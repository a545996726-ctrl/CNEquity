"""Per-product contract specifications for futures and options.

The daily files say which contracts traded and at what price. They do not say
how many units one lot is, or whether an option can be exercised early. Those
come from each product's contract rules, which change rarely but do change, so
some products carry more than one version. A version takes effect by the
contract's **delivery month** (``from_delivery``), because that is how the
exchanges roll a revision in: the new terms apply from a named contract
onward, while contracts already listed keep the old ones.

Multipliers were measured rather than transcribed. SHFE publishes per-product
turnover, volume and average price in every file since 2002 (and CZCE, GFEX
and later SHFE files publish per-contract turnover), so ``turnover /
(volume × price)`` recovers the lot size. It was sampled once a year across
each exchange's whole history (2026-09-25) and snapped to the nearest standard
size. It was constant for every product except three:

- **SHFE fu**: 10 t → 50 t from ~fu1208, then back to 10 t in the 2018 relaunch
  (fu1901 onward). The product-level ratio moved 10.0 → 10.4 → 11.6 → 39.7
  → 50.0 between 2011-08 and 2011-12 as the new contracts took volume.
- **SHFE ru**: 5 t → 10 t from RU1208 (the exchange's own 2012 review names
  RU1208 as the first 10-ton contract).
- **SHFE pb**: 25 t → 5 t on 2013-09 for the whole product at once. The ratio
  jumped 25 → 5 between 2013-08-27 and 2013-09-06 with no mixed session, so
  contracts that were live across that week changed size mid-life. The table
  can only give one size per contract; it gives pb1309 onward 5 t.

Option lots are one underlying futures contract, so an option's multiplier is
its underlying's (the CZCE reference file says so for every product:
「1手…期货合约」). CFFEX index options are the exception, at 100 CNY a point.

Exercise styles: every commodity option is American, except SHFE copper and
gold, which were European until the series on CU2211 and AU2212 (SHFE,
2020-07-31 notice). CFFEX index options are European.

Ticks are each product's current minimum price increment, taken from the
traded prices of the latest sampled session. The audit checks that traded
prices sit on this grid, so a wrong entry surfaces there. DCE option ticks are
the only entries not read off prices: DCE options are not collected while its
own endpoints are unreachable, and the values are there for the opt-in
official route.
