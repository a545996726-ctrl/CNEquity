# Dataset catalog

cnequity's registered datasets include curated data and derived data (`adj_factors`, `industry_index`, `futures_continuous`, `option_greeks`, `delisting_events`, plus `minute_bars_15m` / `minute_bars_30m` / `minute_bars_60m`, which are not computed by default and are derived on request), grouped by stock-selection use into ten tiers, L0–L9. There are also **on-demand** datasets that stay off the curated main path. Among them, the intraday datasets `minute_bars` / `minute_bars_5m` are off by default and must be enabled explicitly in `[minute_bars]`; trade ticks (`trade_ticks`) are also off by default, with the switch in a **separate** `[trade_ticks]` section. The futures/options main tables (`futures_contracts`, `option_contracts`, `futures_bars`, `option_bars`) are off by default, are switched on in `[futures]`, and are not part of `cne init` (see [Product boundaries](../architecture/overview.md)).

The registry includes optional entries, compatibility entries and placeholders for retired sources: `flash_news_wire` is a compatibility read for news, and `economic_calendar` is a placeholder for a retired source. The registered count is neither the number of physically separate tables nor the number of datasets collected by default.

Find data by the L0–L9 tiers below first, then check the collection semantics and history limits; for query examples to copy, go to the [Query guide](query-guide.md).

Authoritative field definitions: [schema.md](schema.md). Per-source limits: [sources.md](sources.md).

Programmatic availability start and history mode: `list_datasets()` → `coverage_start` / `coverage_end` / `history_mode` / `backfill_source`.

**Legend** (tables below): semantics `by_date` / `snapshot`; watermark ✓ = maintains a `meta/state` watermark.

## Data tiers

| Tier | Description | Representative datasets |
|------|------|------------|
| **L0** Reference | Universe, ETF catalog, calendar, trading status | instruments, etf_profiles, trading_calendar, trading_status |
| **L1** Market data | Unadjusted prices and volumes + adjustment factors + optional minute bars/trade ticks + delisting patterns | daily_bars, index_bars, minute_bars*, minute_bars_5m*, minute_bars_15m* / 30m* / 60m*, trade_ticks*, adj_factors, delisting_events |
| **L2** Corporate events | Ex-rights/ex-dividend, announcements, scheduled disclosures | corporate_actions, announcement_index, earnings_disclosure_schedule |
| **L3** Fundamentals | Financial statements, valuation, analyst consensus | financial_statement_items, valuation_metrics, analyst_consensus |
| **L4** Capital flows | Northbound, margin financing, main-force flows | fund_flow, fund_flow_ths, northbound_*, margin_trading, dragon_tiger, block_trades, institutional_holdings |
| **L5** Structure and industry | Sectors, index constituents, industries | sector_members, index_constituents, industry_members, industry_index |
| **L6** Macro | Interest rates, business climate, money | macro_indicators, market_breadth |
| **L7** Sentiment / rotation | News, sentiment, sectors, popularity, event streams | sentiment_scores, hot_rank, sector_bars, sector_fund_flow, sector_fund_flow_ths, news_headlines, flash_news_wire, economic_calendar* (stock_news is on-demand) |
| **L8** Risk and compliance | Share unlocks, regulation | share_unlock_schedule, regulatory_events |
| **L9** Derivatives | Futures/options contracts, per-contract bars, continuous contracts, Greeks, minute bars, and commodity futures main continuous contracts | commodity_bars*, futures_contracts*, option_contracts*, futures_bars*, option_bars*, futures_continuous*, option_greeks*, futures_minute_bars* |

\*Optional or `required=false`: minute bars are off by default; commodity futures need an explicit backfill; the four futures/options tables need `[futures] enabled = true`; the EastMoney source for `economic_calendar` has been retired, so it is only a placeholder.

Tiers describe **research use** and are orthogonal to the storage `layer`: `adj_factors` / `delisting_events` (L1) and `industry_index` (L5) live in `derived/` rather than `curated/`, but are filed under their tiers by use, so there is no separate "derived" tier. Per [Product boundaries](../architecture/overview.md), futures/options sit alongside the equity system; contracts, market data and derived series all belong to L9 and are viewed as one group in the dashboard and the catalog. The authoritative source is `DatasetSpec.tier`; `test_docs_catalog.py` asserts that this document matches the registry tier by tier.

## Collection modes

| Mode | Meaning | Examples |
|------|------|------|
| **batch** | Daily/weekly updates, via staging → compact → curated | daily_bars, fund_flow |
| **derived** | Computed from curated; can be recomputed with `cne derive` | adj_factors |
| **on-demand** | Fetched per symbol, cached in meta | stock_news, research_reports |

### Fetch semantics (fetch_semantics)

| Value | Behavior | Example datasets |
|----|------|------------|
| `by_date` | Gaps can be backfilled by date | daily_bars, margin_trading |
| `snapshot` | Captures only the snapshot on the run date; fabricating history is forbidden | valuation_metrics, sector_members |

If a `snapshot` dataset has a `backfill_source` configured (e.g. `valuation_metrics` → baostock, `sector_bars` → ths), `cne backfill` may use that dedicated history source.

### History availability (history_mode) {#history-availability-history_mode}

Derived from `fetch_semantics` + `backfill_source` (see `list_datasets()`):

| history_mode | Meaning | Datasets |
|--------------|------|--------|
| `by_date` | Can be backfilled by date / gaps can be filled | Most market data and event tables |
| `snapshot_with_backfill` | Daily updates are snapshots, but a dedicated history source exists | `valuation_metrics`→baostock; `index_constituents`→cni; `industry_members`→sw; `sector_bars`→ths |
| `snapshot_only` | Returns only the current snapshot; accumulates day by day once enabled, but past dates that were not collected cannot be backfilled | `analyst_consensus`, `fund_flow`, `sector_members`, `hot_rank`, `sector_fund_flow`, `news_headlines`, `flash_news_wire`, `economic_calendar` |

Suspension coverage in `trading_status` can be derived back to the start of `daily_bars`; ST coverage must be backed by a complete `historical_st_evidence` receipt. Without a receipt covering the requested window, do **not** assume that `universe="all_a"` has excluded historical ST since 2001. For BJ, Tushare Pro is optional: historical short names via `bak_basic` for 2016, and `stock_st` from 2017-01-01; before 2016 a separate, deeper history source is still required.

### What `trade_ticks` is, and what it is not

**It is not tick-by-tick trades.** A-share Level-1 data is **a snapshot every 3 seconds**, and TDX "trade ticks" are aggregates of that snapshot.

This leads to three conventions you must know:

| Item | Reality |
|----|------|
| Timestamp | **Minute precision only**; the seconds field is always `00`. It is not truncated — the protocol never carried seconds |
| Primary key | Hence `(symbol, trade_date, tick_seq)` — the same minute can have 20 records with identical timestamps |
| `direction` | Direction **inferred** by TDX with the tick rule, not an exchange field; four values `buy` / `sell` / `neutral` / `after_hours` |

`after_hours` is post-close fixed-price trading from 15:05–15:30; its price always equals the day's last trade price, and it is **not counted in the exchange's daily volume** —
you must remove it before reconciling with daily data.

**There is no `amount` column.** The source does not provide it; you can compute `price × volume` yourself, but be aware that it is an approximation:
several trades at different prices within one frame are merged into a single representative price. This approximation is not guaranteed to equal the true turnover.

For compliance boundaries see [legal-and-data-sources](../legal-and-data-sources.md): this is **not** exchange Level-2 — there is no order-by-order data and no 10-level order book.

### History horizon: two mechanisms, do not mix them up

`history_mode` tells you **whether** you can backfill; this section tells you **how far back**. Source-side limits come in two kinds with completely different shapes:

**(1) A fixed number of bars per symbol** (`history_horizon_days`) — minute bars work this way. The value is "how many trading days the source still provides", and it rolls forward with today.

| Dataset | history_horizon_days | Window meaning |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| minute_bars (1m) | **95** | Client default backfill window; actual dates depend on trading activity |
| minute_bars_5m (5m) | **491** | Client default backfill window, about 2 years |

**(2) A fixed date floor** (`history_floor_date`) — trade ticks and northbound flows work this way. It **does not roll with today**, so the horizon gets **longer** day by day.

| Dataset | history_floor_date | Boundary meaning |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| trade_ticks | **2024-01-02** | Earliest request date the client allows; does not imply full coverage for every symbol |
| northbound_flows | **2014-11-17** | Launch date of Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect; no such flow feed exists before it |
| futures_bars | **2002-01-07** | Earliest date for which SHFE files are available; ZCE 2010-01-04, CFFEX 2010-04-16, GFEX 2022-12-22, with each exchange's start clipped by the adapter |
| option_bars | **2017-04-19** | First day of ZCE white sugar options; SHFE 2018-09-21, CFFEX 2019-12-23, GFEX 2022-12-23 |

The difference is not academic: if you write a fixed floor as a rolling day count, `earliest_available()` moves forward every day, and within a few months it shuts out data the source is still willing to provide.

Upstream retention may change; when you hit a range error, check the version and the data source limits first.

If both `history_horizon_days` and `history_floor_date` are empty, it only means the registry declares no uniform history boundary; you cannot infer from it that the source has unlimited history.

This is **a property of the source, not a to-do item for this lake**. An earlier window does not return less data; it returns no data, and no backfill source can deepen it — looking at `by_date` alone would make you think you could backfill ten years.

**Minute bars are retained as a number of bars per symbol.** Less actively traded symbols may cover a longer calendar span; do not read the default window as a guarantee of continuous history for every symbol.

`cne backfill minute_bars --start` earlier than the horizon fails with an error instead of scanning a whole day and returning nothing. To pull deep history for thinly traded symbols, first narrow `[minute_bars].scope` to a watchlist. Programmatic read: the `history_horizon_days` column of `list_datasets()`.

`cne backfill trade_ticks --start` is blocked the same way, but with a different message: the trade-tick floor is the same for every symbol, so **no narrower scope can reach earlier data**.

### `trade_ticks` capacity

Trade ticks are paged by symbol and trading day; request count, row count and on-disk size vary with symbol activity and history range. Concurrent connections can cut idle network waiting, but they do not raise the request-start rate the shared rate limiter allows. Observe batch progress and actual partition sizes on a small scope first, then decide on the watchlist and lookback window; do not estimate full-market completion time from the throughput of a single egress.

That is why `[trade_ticks].max_symbols` defaults to 200 in the config: `index:000300.SH` resolves to about 300 symbols and fails immediately;
to run it you have to raise the limit yourself — this friction is intentional. `scope = "all"` is not supported and is rejected at config validation.

### 15m / 30m / 60m: not computed by default, can be stored on request

15m / 30m / 60m are not fetched from the source; they are resampled from the 1m and 5m data in the lake. They are not computed by default and are not part of the daily update; you can compute them on the fly at query time:

```python
from cnequity.query import load, resample_minute_history

window = dict(start="2026-07-01", symbols=["600519.SH"])
bars_15m = resample_minute_history(load("minute_bars", **window),
                                   load("minute_bars_5m", **window), "15m")
```

To read them directly through SQL, the HTTP API or MCP, compute them into the lake:

```bash
cne derive minute_bars_15m                                    # only trading days not yet computed or whose inputs changed
cne derive minute_bars_60m --start 2025-01-02 --end 2025-12-31
```

Once stored, read them like any other dataset with `load("minute_bars_15m", adjust="hfq")`. For the computation rules, the web dashboard entry point and the ways to read them, see [15 / 30 / 60-minute bars](../recipes/minute-bars-15-30-60.md). The morning and afternoon sessions are aligned from 09:30 and 13:00 respectively; for how bars computed from 5m differ from those computed from 1m, see the [Query guide](query-guide.md#trade-based-minute-resampling).

## Coverage that requires an API key

The THS official API (`ths_official`) is an **optional source**: a lake without a key keeps its existing sources, and daily updates are unaffected
(see [THS integration](../getting-started/configuration.md#ths-official-api)). Once enabled, it can fill gaps in
financial statements and historical daily bars, subject to the license and actual coverage; the `source` column identifies the source. The server-side lower bound of history, field completeness and PIT
evidence must still be verified against your own query window; another lake's row counts or ranges are not a commitment for this lake.

The following capabilities write only to `meta/source_snapshots`, **do not enter curated**, and are used only by the arbitration checks in `cne audit`:
`adj_factor_arbitration`, `daily_bars_arbitration`, `financial_statement_peer`.
Without snapshots they stay silent and do not affect the other checks.

THS official valuation snapshots can only accumulate day by day after enabling; old dates cannot be replayed to fabricate observations.
This does not mean `valuation_metrics` has no other history source at all; the coverage and definitions of different sources must be verified separately.

For full background see [THS integration](../getting-started/configuration.md#ths-official-api).

## Provenance columns (all curated rows)

| Column | Type | Description |
|----|------|------|
| `source` | string | Data source identifier |
| `data_version` | string | Source version/batch |
| `fetched_at` | timestamp[us, UTC] | Fetch time |

PIT datasets with `announce_date` (`load(..., as_of=)`): `financial_statement_items`, `announcement_index`.

On-demand datasets (`[on_demand].datasets`): by default `stock_news`, `research_reports` (implemented). `announcement_body` / `financial_reports` are not implemented yet. Access: `cne query --dataset <name> --symbol <code>.SH`.

Registry source code: `domain/datasets.py` (`DatasetSpec`), `domain/schemas.py` (Polars dtype / `PRIMARY_KEYS`); `test_dataset_registry.py` asserts they stay in sync.

## L0 Reference

| instruments | — (single-file merge) | symbol | by_date | — | tdx_protocol | EM fills list_date from the A-share and ETF/LOF clists separately; the published exchange ETF catalog fills missing fund listing dates; baostock backfills delisted stocks (`cne backfill instruments`); merge keeps delisted entries |
| etf_profiles | as_of_date (yearly) | symbol, as_of_date | snapshot | — | exchange | SSE ETF subcategories, the SZSE ETF/fund catalog, and official index methodologies verified code by code; only records with sufficient evidence of a domestic equity index enter the research pool. Unknown categories stay unverified, and unobserved historical snapshots cannot be backfilled |
| trading_calendar | trade_date | trade_date | by_date | ✓ | tdx_protocol | Fallback source: exchange CSV; seeded for 2016–2027 |
| trading_status | trade_date (monthly) | symbol, trade_date | by_date | ✓ | eastmoney | baostock ST backfill; derived suspensions are written to monthly partitions. `status` (normal/suspended/**delisted**) and `risk_warning` (ST/*ST) are two columns — the old single column let a suspension overwrite the ST flag; delisted rows are determined from `instruments` and marked `derived_delisted`. Old lakes are read compatibly; for the physical migration see [schema](schema.md#trading_status) |

## L1 Market data

| Dataset | Partition key | Primary key | Semantics | Watermark | Primary source | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|------|------|------|------|
| daily_bars | trade_date | symbol, trade_date | by_date | ✓ | tdx_protocol | Tip gaps are routed from the EastMoney clist into curated; multi-day kline; BJ→sina; once explicitly enabled, only ETFs verified in the official catalog are appended, and other funds do not enter the default daily update; snapshot still stays in audit |
| index_bars | trade_date | symbol, trade_date, frequency | by_date | ✓ | tdx_protocol | |
| minute_bars | trade_date | symbol, trade_date, bar_time, frequency | by_date | ✓ | tdx_protocol | 1m. **Optional**, off by default; scope configured in `[minute_bars]`; **the source has only 95 trading days** (see "History horizon" below); on-disk size grows with symbol count and window; required=false |

| trade_ticks | trade_date | symbol, trade_date, tick_seq | by_date | ✓ | tdx_protocol | Trade ticks. **Optional**, off by default; configured separately in `[trade_ticks]`; **not tick-by-tick trades** (see below); the source goes back to **2024-01-02**; on-disk size grows with the watchlist and window; required=false |
| adj_factors | trade_date | symbol, trade_date, adjust_type | derived | ✓ | sina | hfq only; stocks read `f`, ETF/LOF read `s`; `cne derive adj_factors` |
| delisting_events | — (single-file merge) | symbol | derived | — | derived | End-of-life pattern of each delisted stock; recovered bars come from sina; produced by `cne backfill daily_bars --profile delisted` |

The two intraday datasets share one set of quality checks: duplicate primary keys (generic `pk_unique`), bars outside trading sessions, mismatched `trade_date` and `bar_time`, session gaps, and **two-way volume + turnover reconciliation against daily data**.

## L2 Corporate events

| Dataset | Partition key | Primary key | Semantics | Watermark | Primary source | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|------|------|------|------|
| corporate_actions | ex_date (yearly) | symbol, ex_date, action_type | by_date | ✓ | eastmoney (daily updates) | Backfill: tdx_protocol; for mixed granularity use `scripts/migrations/repartition.py` |
| announcement_index | announce_date | announcement_id | by_date PIT | ✓ | cninfo | `as_of` filtering |
| earnings_disclosure_schedule | report_period | symbol, report_period | by_date | — | eastmoney | Scheduled disclosure calendar (RPT_PUBLIC_BS_APPOIN); current-value semantics, not PIT: changes overwrite scheduled_date (first_scheduled_date keeps the first scheduled date, actual_date is filled in after disclosure); `cne backfill` covers all report periods from 2016 |

## L3 Fundamentals

| Dataset | Partition key | Primary key | Semantics | Watermark | Primary source | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|------|------|------|------|
| financial_statement_items | report_period | symbol, report_period, statement_type, item_code | by_date PIT | — | eastmoney | Partitioned by report period; `cne backfill` starts from 2001 by default (chunked with `--start`/`--end`); PIT is cut off by both `announce_date` and `fetched_at`; baostock is not used for FSI |
| valuation_metrics | trade_date | symbol, trade_date | snapshot | ✓ | eastmoney | Backfill: baostock |
| analyst_consensus | forecast_date | symbol, forecast_date | snapshot | ✓ | eastmoney | |
| share_structure | change_date | symbol, change_date, announce_date | by_date PIT | — | eastmoney | Total shares / float / restricted / free float. **Scanned by change date, not by report period**: END_DATE is the share-change date, so requesting only quarter-end dates is not enough |
| shareholder_counts | count_date | symbol, count_date, announce_date | by_date PIT | — | eastmoney | Number of shareholders and average holding per account, an input for ownership concentration. **Also disclosed at ten-day-period and month ends**: do not filter by quarter-end dates only |
| top_holders | record_date | symbol, record_date, holder_scope, holder_rank, holder_name, announce_date | by_date PIT | — | eastmoney | One table, two scopes: `holder_scope=total` (top 10 shareholders) / `float` (top 10 float shareholders). Disclosure dates do not necessarily fall at quarter end |

## L4 Capital flows

| Dataset | Partition key | Primary key | Semantics | Watermark | Primary source | staleness |
|--------|--------|------|------|------|------|-----------|
| fund_flow | trade_date | symbol, trade_date | snapshot | ✓ | eastmoney | 1d |
| fund_flow_ths | trade_date | symbol, trade_date | snapshot | ✓ | ths | Filled from THS only when push2 cannot provide `fund_flow`: inflow/outflow/net/turnover, with **no** main-force and extra-large…small order breakdown, amounts to 4 significant digits; source coverage is whatever the response returns, BSE is not promised; no freshness check, and no report when empty |
| margin_trading | trade_date | symbol, trade_date | by_date | ✓ | exchange | Margin trading details compiled by the SSE and SZSE themselves; SH has no securities-lending balance (`short_balance` is null), SZSE publishes one trading day later, and rows are written only once both are in; `[margin_trading] source` can switch back to eastmoney |
| northbound_holdings | trade_date | symbol, trade_date, channel | by_date | ✓ | eastmoney | 100d (quarterly) |
| northbound_flows | trade_date | trade_date, channel | by_date | ✓ | eastmoney | 2d |
| dragon_tiger | trade_date | symbol, trade_date, reason | by_date | ✓ | eastmoney | 1d; fallback source below |
| block_trades | trade_date | symbol, trade_date, price, volume | by_date | ✓ | eastmoney | 1d; fallback source below |
| institutional_holdings | report_period | symbol, holder_type, report_period | by_date | — | eastmoney | — |

`dragon_tiger` and `block_trades` have exchange fallback sources: SZSE `ShowReport` with
`CATALOGID=1265` (dragon-tiger list) and `1842_xxpl_after` (block trades); the SSE counterpart is `1902`.

**A fallback, not a replacement.** Per [Product boundaries](../architecture/overview.md), EastMoney is still the `primary_source`,
and the exchanges are the `backup_source`; **when EastMoney can answer, the fallback is never asked**. Failover sits in the fetch layer, so provenance,
watermarks and compact never need to know which path was taken.

**Neither exchange publishes BSE data**; this is recorded in `backup_gaps` rather than made to look covered.
`share_unlock_schedule` has no fallback source: SZSE records unlocks that **have already happened**, while this dataset is a forward-looking calendar; they are not the same thing.

## L5 Structure and industry

| Dataset | Partition key | Primary key | Semantics | Watermark | Primary source |
|--------|--------|------|------|------|------|
| sector_members | as_of_date | symbol, sector_code, as_of_date | snapshot | ✓ | eastmoney |
| index_constituents | as_of_date | index_symbol, symbol, as_of_date | snapshot | ✓ | eastmoney |
| industry_members | as_of_date | symbol, classification_system, as_of_date | snapshot | ✓ | eastmoney |
| industry_index | trade_date (yearly) | trade_date, industry_code, level, weighting | derived | ✓ | derived (industry_members × hfq daily_bars) |

`industry_index` belongs to L5 rather than L1: the unit of observation is an industry, not a security, and it is computed from this tier's membership, so the index and its constituents never disagree. Recompute it with `cne derive industry_index`.

Snapshot datasets accumulate only "one membership record per day"; historical percentiles need partitions accumulated over many days.

Historical backfill (C2): `cne backfill industry_members` = Shenwan SwClass2021 monthly (`classification_system=sw`, from 2020);
`cne backfill index_constituents` = CNI sample-adjustment history (399001/399006, from about 2021-12). CSI 000300/000905 still has only the daily EM snapshot.

| sector_fund_flow_ths | trade_date | board_type, sector_code, trade_date | snapshot | ✓ | ths | Filled from THS only when push2 cannot provide `sector_fund_flow`: inflow/outflow/net for industries (881xxx) + concept sectors, amounts in units of 100 million yuan, precise to 0.01; THS sector classification, which does not map to EastMoney sector codes |
| news_headlines | publish_date | news_id | snapshot | ✓ | eastmoney | News headlines |
| flash_news_wire | publish_date | wire_id, wire_source | compatibility read | ✓ | eastmoney | Projected from the `news_headlines` fact table, compatible with entity files from old revisions; no longer written twice |
| economic_calendar | event_date (yearly) | event_id | snapshot | ✓ | — (source retired) | EM `RPT_ECONOMICCALENDAR` has been retired (code 9501); the schema is kept pending a replacement source; `required=false`, an empty table is not judged UNHEALTHY |

`sector_bars` uses THS sector market data; history is filled in window by window with `cne backfill sector_bars`. Check the range with `--plan` first, and after failures resume with `--retry-failed` to avoid needless `--force` refetches. Network reachability is determined by a small-scope probe from the current egress.

Futures and options contracts, per-contract market data and derived series, plus the commodity futures main continuous contracts integrated earlier. All are `required=false`; except for `commodity_bars`, they are enabled through `[futures]` and are not part of `cne init`.

| futures_bars | trade_date (monthly) | symbol, trade_date | by_date | ✓ | futures_exchange | Per-contract daily bars, including settlement price and open interest; **single-sided convention** (pre-2020 double-sided values from SHFE/INE/DCE/ZCE have been halved); turnover in yuan; OHLC is null on rows with no trades; each exchange is its own failure domain — if one is missing the others are still written, with a three-day lookback plus retries of a persistent backlog; reads SHFE (including INE, from 2002), ZCE (from 2010), GFEX (from 2022-12) and CFFEX (from 2010-04-16); for DCE see sources.md; required=false |
| option_bars | trade_date | symbol, trade_date | by_date | ✓ | futures_exchange | Per-contract option daily bars, including settlement price, open interest, exercise volume and exchange-published Delta/IV; on expiry day, out-of-the-money contracts are stored with a settlement price of 0; SHFE/INE from 2018-09, ZCE from 2017-04-19, GFEX from 2022-12-23, CFFEX IO/MO/HO from 2019-12-23; required=false |
| futures_continuous | trade_date (monthly) | symbol, series, trade_date | derived | ✓ | derived | Dominant / second-dominant continuous contracts: the contract used on day T depends only on T-1 closing open interest, rolls only forward, and gives way 5 days before the last trading day (or on entering the delivery month); `adj_ratio`/`adj_diff` are cumulative roll factors; `roll_yield` is the annualized roll yield of the dominant over the second-dominant contract; `cne derive futures_continuous`; required=false |
| option_greeks | trade_date | symbol, trade_date | derived | ✓ | derived | This lake's own option IV and Greeks: implied from settlement prices, Black-76 for European and BAW for American options; commodity options use the same-day futures settlement price as the underlying, and CFFEX index options back out the forward via put-call parity; the rate is shibor_3m, falling back to 2% when missing and noted in `rate_source`; `status` explains why there is no solution (`expiry_day` on expiry day); `cne derive option_greeks` tracks content dependencies on bars/contracts/rates/model and automatically recomputes invalidated dates; required=false |
| futures_minute_bars | trade_date | symbol, bar_time | by_date | ✓ | sina | Futures 1-minute bars, **watchlist only** (`[futures] minute_*`); Sina keeps only the latest 1023 bars per contract (about 2 trading days for products with a night session), so data can only accumulate from the day it is enabled and must be run every trading day; night-session bars belong to the next trading day; required=false |

## Primary/fallback configuration (Failover → meta/source_snapshots)

| Dataset | Primary source | Fallback source |
|--------|------|------|
| daily_bars | tdx_protocol | eastmoney |
| corporate_actions | eastmoney | tdx_protocol |

## Checks against the publisher (authority checks)

Primary/fallback comparison compares two redistributors: agreement only shows that they do not conflict, not which one is right. The following checks go past the redistributors directly to the upstream publishing institution,
write to `meta/quality/source_diffs/authority-<date>.json`, and report without blocking (see [Product boundaries](../architecture/overview.md)).

| Check | Dataset | Reference |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `macro_pmi_vs_nbs` | macro_indicators | National Bureau of Statistics PMI releases |
| `st_labels_vs_exchange` | trading_status | Short names in the SSE/SZSE securities lists |
| `daily_bars_vs_exchange` | daily_bars | Closing quotes published by the SSE/SZSE themselves |
| `adj_factor_corporate_action_divergence` | adj_factors | Adjustment factor steps recomputed independently from `corporate_actions` |
| `adj_factor_pre_close_divergence` | adj_factors | The step `previous trading day's close ÷ pre_close` implied by the exchange-published previous close (`daily_bars.pre_close`) |

Price and turnover use separate tolerances. Turnover is also judged by the share of deviating symbols, to avoid per-symbol false positives caused by differences in statistical scope. Exchange zero-volume records for suspended securities are not treated as market-data gaps; `daily_bars_missing_vs_exchange` counts only symbols that traded.

The `adj_factors` recomputation is based on the continuity identity on the ex-rights/ex-dividend date:

```
f_ex / f_prev = (1 + bonus ratio + conversion ratio + rights ratio) × prev_close / (prev_close − pre-tax cash dividend + rights ratio × rights price)
```

With no ex-date, the right-hand side is always 1, so both "the factor moved on a day it should not have" and "it did not move on a day it should have" are caught.
The tolerance is a materiality threshold, not an equality test (default 50 bps, escalated to error at ≥200 bps), because the two sources round differently.
